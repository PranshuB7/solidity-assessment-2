Firstly I have created a contract named PToken. My contract has public variables that will store the details about Token Name, Token Abbrveviation, Total Supply named as TName, TAbbrv,TotSuplly.
Then my contract will have a mapping of addresses to balance ---> (address => uint) public Bbalances
I have craeted a mint function that takes 2 parameters a value and an address, this function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the “sender” address by that amount. Like i have initially kept a value of 10000 in the bvalue function. This will be our balance.
The contract then has a burn function, which will works differently from the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It also takes into account an address and value just like the mint functions. The usage of this is that it will be then deduct the value from the total supply. Suppose we have a balance of 10000 and the value of burn function is 5000 then the total supply will eb 5000.
We need to keep in mind that the value of burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be burned as it cant be possible that we our destroying more tokens from that we our having.
